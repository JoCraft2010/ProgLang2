These language docs try to show all features of ProgLang2, but as the language is still highly experimental, everything described here is subject to change. Features may not be fully implemented, and behavior may be unstable or inconsistent.

If a documented feature is incomplete, still under consideration, or has known issues, it will be clearly marked as follows:
